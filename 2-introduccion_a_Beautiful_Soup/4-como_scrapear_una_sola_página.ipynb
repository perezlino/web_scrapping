Meanwhile, a drifter and artist named Jack Dawson and his best friend Fabrizio De Rossi win third-class tickets to the ship in a game.

Hello, Brock.\\nHello, Tracy. Of course, everyone knows\\nthe familiar stories of Titanic.\\nYou know, the nobility of the\\nband playing to the very end and all that.\\nBut what I\\'m interested in are the untold stories.\\nThe secrets locked deep inside the hull of Titanic.\\nAnd we\\'re out here using robot\\ntechnology to go further into the wreck...\\n...than anybody has ever done before.\\nYour expedition is at the center\\nof a storm of controversy...\\n...over salvage rights and even ethics.\\nMany are calling you a graverobber.\\nWell, nobody ever called the\\nrecovery of the artifacts...\\nWhat is it?\\nTurn that up, dear.\\nI have museum-trained experts\\nsent out here making sure...\\n---that these relics are preserved\\nand catalogued properly.\\nTake a look at this drawing\\nthat we found just today.\\nA piece of paper that\\'s been underwater\\nfor 84 years.\\nAnd my team are able to\\npreserve it intact.\\nShould this have remained unseen\\nat the bottom of the ocean for eternity...\\n...when we can see and enjoy it now?\\nI\\'ll be goddamned.\\nBrock!\\nThere\\'s a satellite call for you.\\nBobby, we\\'re launching. You see\\nthese submersibles going in the water?\\nTrust me, buddy.\\nYou want to take this call.\\nThis better be good.\\nNow, you gotta speak up.\\nShe\\'s kind of old.\\nGreat.\\nThis is Brock Lovett.\\nHow can I help you, Mrs...?\\nCalvert. Rose Calvert.\\nMrs. Calvert.\\nI was just wondering if you had found...\\n...the \"Heart of the Ocean\" yet, Mr. Lovett.\\nTold you you wanted to take the call.\\nAll right, you have my\\nattention, Rose.\\nCan you tell us who the woman\\nin the picture is?\\nOh, yes. The woman in the picture is me.\\nShe\\'s a goddamn liar!\\nSome nutcase seeking money or publicity.\\nGod only knows why.\\nLike that Russian babe, Anesthesia.\\nThey\\'re inbound!\\nRose DeWitt Bukater died on the\\nTitanic when she was 17, right?\\n- That\\'s right.\\n- If she had lived, she\\'d be over 100 by now.\\n101 next month.\\nOkay, so she\\'s a very old goddamn liar.\\nLook, I\\'ve already done the\\nbackground on this woman...\\n...all the way back to the 20s,\\nwhen she was working as an actress.\\nAn actress.\\nThere\\'s your first clue, Sherlock.\\nHer name was Rose Dawson back then.\\nThen she marries this guy named Calvert.\\nThey move to Cedar Rapids\\nand she punches out a couple of kids.\\nNow Calvert\\'s dead\\nand, from what I hear, Cedar Rapids is dead.\\nAnd everybody who knows about the\\ndiamond is supposed to be dead...\\n...or on this boat,\\nbut she knows.\\nDoesn\\'t exactly travel light, does she?\\nHurry up, give him a hand.\\nMrs. Calvert, I\\'m Brock Lovett.\\nWelcome to the Keldysh.\\nOkay, let\\'s get her inside there.\\nHi, Miss Calvert.\\n- Hi.\\n- Welcome to the Keldysh.\\nThanks.\\nHey!\\nAre your staterooms\\nall right?\\nOh, yes.\\nVery nice.\\nHave you met my\\ngranddaughter, Lizzy?\\nShe takes care of me.\\nWe met just a few\\nminutes ago.\\nRemember, Nana?\\nUp on deck?\\nOh, yes.\\nThere. That\\'s nice.\\nHave to have my\\npictures when I travel.\\nCan I get you anything?\\nIs there anything you\\'d like?\\nYes.\\nI would like to\\nsee my drawing.\\nLouis XVI wore a fabulous\\nstone that was...\\n...called the Blue Diamond\\nof the Crown...\\n...which disappeared\\nin 1792...\\n...about the same time old Louis lost\\neverything from the neck up.\\nThe theory goes that the\\ncrown diamond was chopped, too.\\nRecut into a heart-like shape that\\nbecame known as...\\n...the Heart of the Ocean.\\nToday it would be worth\\nmore than the Hope diamond.\\nIt was a dreadful,\\nheavy thing.\\nI only wore it this once.\\nYou actually think\\nthis is you, Nana?\\nIt is me, dear.\\nWasn\\'t I a dish?\\nI tracked it down\\nthrough insurance records.\\nAn old claim that was settled\\nunder terms of absolute secrecy.\\nCan you tell me who the\\nclaimant was, Rose?\\nI should imagine someone\\nnamed Hockley.\\nNathan Hockley,\\nthat\\'s right.\\nPittsburgh steel tycoon.\\nThe claim was for a\\ndiamond necklace his son...\\n...Caledon, bought his fiancée.\\nYou.\\nA week before he\\nsailed on Titanic.\\nAnd it was filed right\\nafter the sinking.\\nSo the diamond had to have\\ngone down with the ship.\\nYou see the date?\\nApril 14, 1912\\nWhich means if your grandmother\\nis who she says she is...\\n...she was wearing the diamond\\nthe day the Titanic sank.\\nAnd that makes you\\nmy new best friend.\\nThese are some of the things\\nwe recovered from your stateroom.\\nThis was mine.\\nHow extraordinary.\\nAnd it looks the same as it\\ndid the last time I saw it.\\nThe reflection has\\nchanged a bit.\\nAre you ready to go\\nback to Titanic?\\nOkay, here we go.\\nShe hits the berg on\\nthe starboard side, right?\\nShe kind of bumps along...\\n...punching holes like\\nmorse code...\\n-- dit-dit-dit -- along the side...\\n...below the waterline.\\nThen the forward compartments\\nstart to flood.\\nNow, as the water\\nlevel rises...\\n...it spills over the\\nwatertight bulkheads...\\nwhich, unfortunately, don\\'t go\\nany higher than E deck-\\nSo now as the\\nbow goes down...\\n...the stern rises up,\\nslow at first...\\n...then faster and faster...\\n...until finally, she\\'s got her whole\\nass sticking up in the air.\\nAnd that\\'s a big ass.\\nWe\\'re talking\\n20, 30,000 tons. Okay?\\nAnd the hull\\'s not designed\\nto deal with that pressure.\\nSo, what happens?\\nShe splits, right\\ndown to the keel.\\nAnd the stern...\\n...falls back level.\\nThen...\\n...as the bow sinks...\\n...it pulls the stern vertical...\\n...and then finally detaches.\\nNow the stern section just kind of bobs\\nthere like a cork for a couple of minutes...\\n...floods, and finally goes\\nunder about 2:20 AM...\\n...2 hours and 40 minutes\\nafter the collision.\\nThe bow section\\nplanes away...\\n...landing about a\\nhalf a mile away...\\n...going 20, 30 knots when\\nit hits the ocean floor.\\nPretty cool, huh?\\nThank you for that fine\\nforensic analysis, Mr. Bodine.\\nOf course, the\\nexperience of it was...\\n...somewhat different.\\nWill you share it with us?\\nI\\'m taking her to rest.\\nNo.\\nCome on, Nana.\\nNo!\\nGive me the\\ntape recorder.\\nTell us, Rose.\\nIt\\'s been 84 years--\\nIt\\'s okay. Just try\\nto remember anything...\\n...anything at all.\\nDo you want to hear this\\nor not, Mr. Lovett?\\nIt\\'s been 84 years...\\n...and I can still smell\\nthe fresh paint.\\nThe china had\\nnever been used.\\nThe sheets had\\nnever been slept in.\\nTitanic was called\\nthe ship of dreams.\\nAnd it was.\\nIt really was.\\nAll third-class\\npassengers...\\n...with a forward berth...\\n...this way please!\\nThis queue!\\nIt\\'s a big boat, huh?\\nDaddy, it\\'s a ship.\\nYou\\'re right.\\nI don\\'t see what all\\nthe fuss is about.\\nIt doesn\\'t look any bigger\\nthan the Mauretania.\\nYou can be blasé\\nabout some things, Rose...\\n...but not about Titanic.\\nIt\\'s over 100 feet longer\\nthan Mauretania...\\n...and far more luxurious.\\nYour daughter is far too\\ndifficult to impress, Ruth.\\nSo this is the ship they\\nsay is unsinkable.\\nIt is unsinkable.\\nGod Himself\\ncould not sink this ship--\\nWh at?!\\nYou have to check your baggage\\nthrough the main terminal.\\nIt\\'s round that\\nway, sir.\\nI put my faith in\\nyou good sir.\\nNow kindly\\nsee my man.\\nYes sir.

The floor debris in the suite,\\nthe mother\\'s room... the purser\\'s safe on C deck. Jimmy Hoffa\\'s briefcase. A dozen other places. Guys, look, you\\'re just\\ngoing to have to trust my instincts. I know we\\'re close. We\\'ve just got to go through a little\\nprocess of elimination. Hang on a second. - Let me see that.\\n- Ah, we may have something here, guys. Where\\'s the photograph\\nof the necklace? We\\'ll call you right back. I\\'ll be goddamned. Treasure hunter Brock Lovett\\nis best known for finding Spanish gold... It\\'s okay. I\\'ll feed you in a minute. Now he has chartered Russian subs to reach\\nthe most famous shipwreck of all, the Titanic. He is with us live via satellite\\nfrom the research ship Keldysh... ...in the North Atlantic. Hello, Brock. Hello, Tracy. Of course, everyone knows\\nthe familiar stories of Titanic. You know, the nobility of the\\nband playing to the very end and all that. But what I\\'m interested in are the untold stories.\\nThe secrets locked deep inside the hull of Titanic. And we\\'re out here using robot\\ntechnology to go further into the wreck... ...than anybody has ever done before. Your expedition is at the center\\nof a storm of controversy... ...over salvage rights and even ethics.\\nMany are calling you a graverobber. Well, nobody ever called the\\nrecovery of the artifacts... What is it? Turn that up, dear. I have museum-trained experts\\nsent out here making sure... ---that these relics are preserved\\nand catalogued properly. Take a look at this drawing\\nthat we found just today. A piece of paper that\\'s been underwater\\nfor 84 years. And my team are able to\\npreserve it intact. Should this have remained unseen\\nat the bottom of the ocean for eternity... ...when we can see and enjoy it now? I\\'ll be goddamned. Brock! There\\'s a satellite call for you. Bobby, we\\'re launching. You see\\nthese submersibles going in the water? Trust me, buddy.\\nYou want to take this call. This better be good. Now, you gotta speak up.\\nShe\\'s kind of old. Great. This is Brock Lovett.\\nHow can I help you, Mrs...? Calvert. Rose Calvert. Mrs. Calvert. I was just wondering if you had found... ...the \"Heart of the Ocean\" yet, Mr. Lovett. Told you you wanted to take the call. All right, you have my\\nattention, Rose. Can you tell us who the woman\\nin the picture is? Oh, yes. The woman in the picture is me. She\\'s a goddamn liar!\\nSome nutcase seeking money or publicity. God only knows why.\\nLike that Russian babe, Anesthesia. They\\'re inbound! Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the\\nTitanic when she was 17, right? - That\\'s right.\\n- If she had lived, she\\'d be over 100 by now. 101 next month. Okay, so she\\'s a very old goddamn liar. Look, I\\'ve already done the\\nbackground on this woman... ...all the way back to the 20s,\\nwhen she was working as an actress. An actress.\\nThere\\'s your first clue, Sherlock. Her name was Rose Dawson back then.\\nThen she marries this guy named Calvert. They move to Cedar Rapids\\nand she punches out a couple of kids. Now Calvert\\'s dead\\nand, from what I hear, Cedar Rapids is dead. And everybody who knows about the\\ndiamond is supposed to be dead... ...or on this boat,\\nbut she knows. Doesn\\'t exactly travel light, does she? Hurry up, give him a hand. Mrs. Calvert, I\\'m Brock Lovett.\\nWelcome to the Keldysh. Okay, let\\'s get her inside there. Hi, Miss Calvert. - Hi.\\n- Welcome to the Keldysh. Thanks. Hey! Are your staterooms\\nall right? Oh, yes. Very nice. Have you met my\\ngranddaughter, Lizzy? She takes care of me. We met just a few\\nminutes ago. Remember, Nana?\\nUp on deck? Oh, yes. There. That\\'s nice. Have to have my\\npictures when I travel. Can I get you anything? Is there anything you\\'d like? Yes. I would like to\\nsee my drawing. Louis XVI wore a fabulous\\nstone that was... ...called the Blue Diamond\\nof the Crown... ...which disappeared\\nin 1792... ...about the same time old Louis lost\\neverything from the neck up. The theory goes that the\\ncrown diamond was chopped, too. Recut into a heart-like shape that\\nbecame known as... ...the Heart of the Ocean. Today it would be worth\\nmore than the Hope diamond. It was a dreadful,\\nheavy thing. I only wore it this once. You actually think\\nthis is you, Nana? It is me, dear. Wasn\\'t I a dish? I tracked it down\\nthrough insurance records. An old claim that was settled\\nunder terms of absolute secrecy. Can you tell me who the\\nclaimant was, Rose? I should imagine someone\\nnamed Hockley. Nathan Hockley,\\nthat\\'s right. Pittsburgh steel tycoon. The claim was for a\\ndiamond necklace his son... ...Caledon, bought his fiancée. You. A week before he\\nsailed on Titanic. And it was filed right\\nafter the sinking. So the diamond had to have\\ngone down with the ship. You see the date? April 14, 1912 Which means if your grandmother\\nis who she says she is... ...she was wearing the diamond\\nthe day the Titanic sank. And that makes you\\nmy new best friend. These are some of the things\\nwe recovered from your stateroom. This was mine. How extraordinary. And it looks the same as it\\ndid the last time I saw it. The reflection has\\nchanged a bit. Are you ready to go\\nback to Titanic? Okay, here we go. She hits the berg on\\nthe starboard side, right? She kind of bumps along... ...punching holes like\\nmorse code... -- dit-dit-dit -- along the side... ...below the waterline. Then the forward compartments\\nstart to flood. Now, as the water\\nlevel rises... ...it spills over the\\nwatertight bulkheads... which, unfortunately, don\\'t go\\nany higher than E deck- So now as the\\nbow goes down... ...the stern rises up,\\nslow at first... ...then faster and faster... ...until finally, she\\'s got her whole\\nass sticking up in the air. And that\\'s a big ass. We\\'re talking\\n20, 30,000 tons. Okay? And the hull\\'s not designed\\nto deal with that pressure. So, what happens? She splits, right\\ndown to the keel. And the stern... ...falls back level. Then... ...as the bow sinks... ...it pulls the stern vertical... ...and then finally detaches. Now the stern section just kind of bobs\\nthere like a cork for a couple of minutes... ...floods, and finally goes\\nunder about 2:20 AM... ...2 hours and 40 minutes\\nafter the collision. The bow section\\nplanes away... ...landing about a\\nhalf a mile away... ...going 20, 30 knots when\\nit hits the ocean floor. Pretty cool, huh? Thank you for that fine\\nforensic analysis, Mr. Bodine. Of course, the\\nexperience of it was... ...somewhat different. Will you share it with us? I\\'m taking her to rest. No. Come on, Nana. No! Give me the\\ntape recorder. Tell us, Rose. It\\'s been 84 years-- It\\'s okay. Just try\\nto remember anything... ...anything at all. Do you want to hear this\\nor not, Mr. Lovett? It\\'s been 84 years... ...and I can still smell\\nthe fresh paint. The china had\\nnever been used. The sheets had\\nnever been slept in. Titanic was called\\nthe ship of dreams. And it was. It really was. All third-class\\npassengers... ...with a forward berth... ...this way please!\\nThis queue! It\\'s a big boat, huh? Daddy, it\\'s a ship. You\\'re right. I don\\'t see what all\\nthe fuss is about. It doesn\\'t look any bigger\\nthan the Mauretania. You can be blasé\\nabout some things, Rose... ...but not about Titanic. It\\'s over 100 feet longer\\nthan Mauretania... ...and far more luxurious. Your daughter is far too\\ndifficult to impress, Ruth. So this is the ship they\\nsay is unsinkable. It is unsinkable. God Himself\\ncould not sink this ship-- Wh at?! You have to check your baggage\\nthrough the main terminal. It\\'s round that\\nway, sir. I put my faith in\\nyou good sir. Now kindly\\nsee my man. Yes sir. It\\'s my\\npleasure, sir. If I can do\\nanything at all... Yes, right. All the trunks from\\nthat car there- 12 from here. And the safe,\\nto the parlor suite... ...rooms B-52, 54, 56. Ladies... ...we better hurry. Come along. - My coat?\\n- I have it, miss. All third-class passengers\\nqueue here for health inspection. - Welcome aboard, ma\\'am.\\n- Welcome to Titanic. It was the ship of dreams... ...to everyone else. To me, it was a\\nslave ship... ...taking me back to\\nAmerica in chains. Outwardly, I was everything\\na Well brought up girl should be- Inside, I was screaming. Jack, you are pazzo. You bet everything\\nwe have. When you got nothing,\\nyou got nothing to lose. Sven? All right,\\nmoment of truth. Someone\\'s life is\\nabout to change. Fabrizio? Niente. Olaf? Nothing. Sven? Uh-oh.\\n2 pair. I\\'m sorry,\\nFabrizio. I\\'m sorry... ...you\\'re not gonna see\\nyour mom again for a... ...long time... ...\\'cause we\\'re\\ngoing to America. Full house, boys! Come on. I\\'m going home! I\\'m going home. I go to America! No, mate. Titanic go to America, in 5 minutes. Shit. Fabri.\\nCome on. Come on,\\nhere. Here. We\\'re riding in\\nhigh style now! We\\'re a couple of\\nregular swells. We\\'re practically\\ngoddamn royalty... ...ragazzo mio. You see?\\nls my destine. Like I told you... I go to America to\\nbe millionaire. You are pazzo. Maybe, but I\\'ve\\ngot the tickets. Come on, I thought\\nyou were fast. Aspettal Whoa. Wait! Wait! Hey, wait! We\\'re passengers! Have you been through\\nthe inspection queue? Of course. Anyway, we\\ndon\\'t have any lice. We\\'re Americans.\\nBoth of us. Right. Come aboard. We\\'re the luckiest sons\\nof bitches in the world. You know that? Good-bye! You know somebody? Of course not.\\nThat\\'s not the point. Good-bye!\\nI\\'ll miss you! Good-bye! I will never forget you! Come with me,\\ndarling. Let\\'s go. G-60. G-60. G-60. Excuse me,\\nma\\'am. G-60. Oh, right here. Hey, how you doing? Jack. Nice\\nto meet you. Jack Dawson.\\nNice to meet you. How you doing? Who says you get\\ntop bunk, huh? This is your private\\npromenade deck, sir. Will you be requiring\\nanything? Excuse me. - This one?\\n- No. It had a lot of faces on it. This is the one. Would you like all of\\nthem out, miss? Yes. We need a little\\ncolor in this room. Put in there.\\nIn the wardrobe. God, not those finger\\npaintings again. They certainly were a\\nwaste of money. The difference between\\nCal\\'s taste in art... ...and mine is that I have some. They\\'re fascinating. Like being inside a dream\\nor something. There\\'s truth but no logic. - What\\'s the artist\\'s name?\\n- Something Picasso. Something Picasso. He won\\'t amount\\nto a thing. He won\\'t, trust me. - Let\\'s put the Degas in the bedroom.\\n- At least they were cheap. Put it in the wardrobe. At Cherbourg, a woman came aboard\\nnamed Margaret Brown. We all called her Molly. History would call her\\nthe Unsinkable Molly Brown. Well, I wasn\\'t about to\\nwait all day for you, sonny. Here, if you think\\nyou can manage. Her husband had struck gold\\nsomeplace out west. And she was what Mother\\ncalled \"new money.\" By the next afternoon... ...we were steaming west\\nfrom the coast of Ireland... ...with nothing out ahead\\nof us but ocean. Take herto sea,\\nMr. Murdoch. Let\\'s stretch her legs. Yes sir. All ahead full, Mr. Moody. Very good, sir. All ahead full. All ahead full! Come on lads,\\nstep lively! All right! Let\\'s stoke\\nher right up! We go full ahead! Come on, put your\\nbacks into it! 21 knots, sir. Hey, look,\\nlook, look! See it? There\\'s another\\none! See him? Look at that one!\\nLook at him jump! I can see the Statue\\nof Liberty already. Very small,\\nof course. I\\'m the king\\nof the world! She is the largest moving object\\never made by the hand of man... ...in all history. And our master shipbuilder,\\nMr. Andrews here... ...designed her from the\\nkeel plates up. I may have knocked\\nher together, but--- ...the idea was\\nMr. lsmay\\'s. He envisioned a steamer\\nso grand in scale... ...and so luxurious in... ...its appointments... ...that its supremacy\\nwould never be challenged. And here she is. - Willed into solid reality.\\n- Hear, hear. I\\'ll have the salmon. You know I don\\'t\\nlike that, Rose. She knows. We\\'ll both have\\nthe lamb. Rare, with very\\nlittle mint sauce. You like lamb,\\nright sweet pea? You gonna cut her meat\\nfor her too there, Cal? Hey, who thought of\\nthe name Titanic? Was it you,\\nBruce? Yes, actually. I wanted to convey sheer size.\\nAnd size means stability... ...luxury, and above\\nall, strength. Do you know of\\nDr. Freud, Mr. lsmay? His ideas about the male preoccupation\\nwith size might be of particular interest to you. What\\'s gotten into you? Excuse me. I do apologize. She\\'s a pistol, Cal.\\nHope you can handle her. Well, I may have to start minding what she\\nreads from now on, won\\'t I, Mrs. Brown? Freud? Who is he?\\nIs he a passenger? The ship is nice, huh? Yeah. It\\'s an Irish ship. Is English, no? No, it was built\\nin Ireland. 15,000 lrishmen\\nbuilt this ship. Solid as a rock.\\nBig Irish hands. That\\'s typical. First-class dogs\\ncome down here to take a shite. Lets us know where we rank\\nin the scheme of things. Like we could forget? I\\'m Tommy Ryan. - Jack Dawson.\\n- Fabrizio. Do you make any money\\nwith your drawings? Ah, forget it, boyo. You\\'d as like have angels fly out of\\nyour arse as get next to... ...the likes of her. I saw my whole life\\nas if I\\'d already lived it. An endless parade\\nof parties and cotillions... yachts and polo matches. Always the same narrow people,\\nthe same mindless chatter. I felt like I was standing\\nat a great precipice... ...with no one to pull me back.\\nNo one who cared... ...or even noticed. Don\\'t do it. Stay back. Don\\'t come any closer. Come on. Just give me your hand.\\nI\\'ll pull you back over. No!\\nStay where you are. I mean it. I\\'ll let go. No, you won\\'t. What do you mean,\\nno I won\\'t? Don\\'t presume to tell me\\nwhat I will and will not do. You don\\'t know me. Well, you would have done it already. You\\'re distracting me.\\nGo away. I can\\'t. I\\'m involved now. You let go, and I\\'m going to have\\nto jump in there after you. Don\\'t be absurd. - You\\'ll be killed.\\n- I\\'m a good swimmer. The fall alone will kill you. It would hurt. I\\'m not\\nsaying it wouldn\\'t. Tell you the truth... ...I\\'m a lot more concerned\\nabout that water being so cold. How cold? Freezing.\\nMaybe a couple degrees over. You ever, uh... ...ever been\\nto Wisconsin? Wh at? Well, they have some of\\nthe coldest winters around. I grew up there,\\nnear Chippewa Falls. I remember when I was a kid,\\nme and my father, we went ice fishing... ...out on Lake Wissota. Ice fishing is, you know, where you-- I know what ice fishing is! Sorry. You just seem like, you know,\\nkind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I... ...fell through some thin ice. And I\\'m telling you... ...water that cold, like right down there... ...it hits you like 1000 knives\\nstabbing you all over your body. You can\\'t breathe. You can\\'t think. Least not about\\nanything but the pain. Which is why I\\'m not looking\\nforward to jumping in there after you. Like I said... ...I don\\'t have a choice. I guess I\\'m kind of hoping you\\'ll\\ncome back over the rail and... ...and get me off\\nthe hook here. You\\'re crazy. That\\'s what everybody says but... ...with all due respect, miss... ...I\\'m not the one hanging off\\nthe back of a ship here. Come on. Come on, give me your hand. You don\\'t want to do this. I\\'m Jack Dawson. Rose DeWitt Bu kater. I\\'ll have to get you to\\nwrite that one down. Come on. I got you. Come on. Come on. Help, please! Help! - Please, help me!\\n- Listen. Listen to me. Listen. Listen to me. I\\'ve got you.\\nI won\\'t let go. Now pull yourself up.\\nCome on! Come on. That\\'s right. You can do it. I got you. What\\'s all this? You stand back and... ...don\\'t move an inch! Fetch the Master at Arms. This is completely unacceptable! What made you think that you could\\nput your hands on my fiancée?! Look at me, you filth! Cal. What do you think\\nyou were doing? Cal, stop.\\nIt was an accident. An accident? It was. Stupid, really. I was leaning over and I slipped. I was leaning far over\\nto see the, uh... ...uh, uh, the uh... - Propellers?\\n- Propellers, and I slipped. And I would have gone\\noverboard but Mr. Dawson here... ...saved me. And almost\\nwent over himself. You wanted to see the...\\nShe wanted to see the propellers. Like I said, women and\\nmachinery do not mix. Was that the way of it? Yeah. Yeah, that\\nwas pretty much it. Well, the boy\\'s a hero then. Good for you, son.\\nWell done. So, it\\'s all\\'s well and back\\nto our brandy, eh? Look at you. You must be freezing.\\nLet\\'s get you inside. Perhaps a little something\\nfor the boy? Of course. Mr. Lovejoy,\\nI think a 20 should do it. Is that the going rate\\nfor saving the woman you love? Rose is displeased. What to do? I know. Perhaps you could join us for\\ndinner tomorrow evening... ...to regale our group... ...with your heroic tale. Sure.\\nCount me in. Good.\\nIt\\'s settled then. This should be interesting. Can I bum a smoke? You\\'ll want to tie those. It\\'s interesting... ...the young lady slipped\\nso suddenly... ...and you still had time to remove\\nyour jacket and your shoes. I know you\\'ve been melancholy. I don\\'t pretend to know why. I intended to save this... ...until the engagement\\ngala next week... ...but, I thought... ...tonight. Good gracious. Perhaps as a reminder\\nof my feelings for you. - Is it a--\\n- Diamond. Yes. 56 carats to be exact. It was worn by Louis XVI. And they called\\nit Le Coeur de Ia Mer. - The Heart of the Ocean.\\n- The Heart of the Ocean. Yes. It\\'s overwhelming. Well, it\\'s for royalty. We are royalty, Rose. You know, there\\'s\\nnothing I couldn\\'t give you. There\\'s nothing I\\'d deny you... ...if you would not deny me. Open your heart to me, Rose. Well, I\\'ve been on my own since\\nI was 15, since my folks died. And I had no brothers or sisters or\\nclose kin in that part of the country... ...so I lit on out of there and I\\nhaven\\'t been back since. You could just call me a\\ntumbleweed blowing in the wind. Well, Rose, we\\'ve walked about a mile\\naround this boat deck and... ...chewed over how great the weather\\'s\\nbeen and how I grew up... ...but I reckon that\\'s not why\\nyou came to talk to me, is it? - Mr. Dawson, I--\\n- Jack. Jack. I want to thank you\\nfor what you did. Not just for pulling me back,\\nbut for your discretion. You\\'re welcome. Look. I know what you\\nmust be thinking. Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery? No. No, that\\'s not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... ---what could have happened to this girl\\nto make her think she had no way out? Well I... It was everything.\\nIt was my whole world and... ...all the people in it. And the inertia of my life,\\nplunging ahead and me... ...powerless to stop it. God,\\nlook at that thing. You would have gone\\nstraight to the bottom. 500 invitations have gone out. All of Philadelphia society will be there. And all the while I feel I\\'m... ...standing in the middle\\nof a crowded room... ...screaming at the\\ntop of my lungs... ...and no one\\neven looks up. Do you love him? Pardon me? Do you love him? You\\'re being very rude. You\\nshouldn\\'t be asking me this. Well, it\\'s a simple question.\\nDo you love the guy or not? This is not a suitable conversation. VVhy can\\'t you just\\nanswer the question? This is absurd. You don\\'t know me\\nand I don\\'t know you... ...and we are not having this\\nconversation at all. You are rude... ...and uncouth and presumptuous\\nand I am leaving now... ...Jack. Mr. Dawson.\\nIt\\'s been a pleasure. I sought you out to thank you\\nand now I have thanked you. And you\\'ve insulted me. Well, you deserved it. - Right.\\n- Right. I thought you were leaving. I am. You are so annoying. Wait. I don\\'t have to leave. This is\\nmy part of the ship. You leave. Well, well, well.\\nNow who\\'s being rude? What is this stupid thing\\nyou\\'re carrying around? So, what are you,\\nan artist or something? These are rather good. They\\'re very good, actually. Jack, this is exquisite work. Ah, they didn\\'t think too\\nmuch of them in old Paree. Paris? You do get around\\nfor a p-- Well, a-- a\\nperson of limited means. Go on. A poor guy. You can say it. Well, well, well. And these were drawn from life? Well, that\\'s one of the good things about Paris. Lots of girls are willing\\nto take their clothes off. You liked this woman. You used her several times. Well. She had beautiful\\nhands, you see? I think you must have\\nhad a love affair with her. No, no, no.\\nJust with her hands. She was a\\none-legged prostitute. See? She had a good\\nsense of humor though. Oh, and this lady... She used to sit at this bar every night... ...wearing every piece\\nof jewelry she owned... ...just waiting for\\nher long, lost love. We called her Madame Bijoux. See, her clothes are all moth-eaten. Well,\\nyou have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people. I see you. And? You wouldn\\'t have jumped. But the purpose of university\\nis to find a suitable husband. Rose has already done that. Look, here comes that\\nvulgar Brown woman. Quickly, get up before\\nshe sits with us. Hello, girls. I was hoping\\nI\\'d catch you at tea. We\\'re awfully sorry,\\nyou missed it. The Countess and I were just\\noff to take the air on the boat deck. What a lovely idea.\\nI need to catch up on my gossip. Countess. So, you\\'ve not yet lit the\\nlast four boilers? No, I don\\'t see\\nthe need. We are making excellent time. The press knows the size of Titanic.\\nNow, I want them to marvel at her speed. We must give them\\nsomething new to print. This maiden voyage\\nof Titanic must... ...make headlines. Mr. lsmay, I would prefer\\nnot to push the engines... ...until they\\'ve been properly run in. Of course I\\'m just a passenger. I leave it to your good offices\\nto decide what\\'s best. But what a glorious end to your final crossing... ...if we were to get into New York\\non Tuesday night... ...and surprise them all.\\nMake the morning papers. Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.? Good man. After that, I worked\\non a squid boat in Monterey... ...then I went to Los Angeles to the... ...Santa Monica pier\\nand did portraits for 10 cents each. Why can\\'t I be like you? Just head out for the horizon\\nwhenever I feel like it. Say we\\'ll go there sometime, to that pier... only if we just talk about it No, we\\'ll do it. We\\'ll drink cheap beer. Ride on the roller coaster till we throw up We\\'ll ride horses on the beach, in the surf. But you have to do it like a real cowboy.\\nNo sidesaddle stuff. You mean with one leg on each side? Can you show me? Sure, if you like. Teach me to ride like a man. Chew tobacco like a man. And spit like a man. You didn\\'t learn in finishing school? No. Come on, I\\'ll show you. I\\'ll show you how. Jack! No, Jack, no. Wait. I couldn\\'t possibly, Jack. Watch closely. That\\'s disgusting. Your turn That was pitiful.\\nYou really have to hawk it back. Get some leverage.\\nUse your arms. Arc your neck. You see the range on that thing? Okay, go. That was better. You have to work on it.\\nReally try to hawk it up. Mother. May I introduce Jack Dawson? Charmed, I\\'m sure. The others were gracious and curious\\nabout the man who\\'d saved my life. But my mother looked at him like an insect. A dangerous insect\\nwhich must be squashed quickly. Sounds like you\\'re a good man\\nto have around in a sticky spot. Why do they always insist on announcing\\ndinner like a damn cavalry charge? Shall we go dress, Mother? See you at dinner, Jack. Uh, son? Son! Do you have any idea what you\\'re doing? Not really. You\\'re about to go into the snake pit. What are you going to wear? I figured. Come on. I was right. You and my son\\nare just about the same size. Pretty close. You shine up like a new penny. Good evening, sir. Thousands of tons of Hockley steel\\nare in this ship. - Which part?\\n- All the right ones. Then you\\'re accountable\\nif there\\'s a problem. Where\\'s Rose? She\\'ll be along. There is the Countess. I saw that in a nickelodeon\\nand always wanted to do it. Darling... ...surely you remember Mr. Dawson. It\\'s amazing.\\nYou could almost pass for a gentleman. Almost. This is extraordinary. This is a remarkable voyage. - Mad.\\n- Completely lunatic. There\\'s the Countess of Rothes. That\\'s John Jacob Astor... ...the richest man on board. His little wifey, Madeleine,\\nis my age and in a delicate condition. See how she tries to hide it. Quite the scandal. Benjamin Guggenheim and his mistress,\\nMadame Aubert. Mrs. Guggenheim... ...is at home with the children, of course.\\nAnd over here... ...Sir Cosmo and Lucile, Lady Duff-Gordon. She designs naughty lingerie,\\namong her many talents. Very popular with the royals. Congratulations. She\\'s splendid. Why, thank you. Escort a lady to dinner? Certainly. Sweet pea, sweet pea. Ain\\'t nothing to it. They love money. Pretend like you own\\na gold mine and you\\'re in the club. Hey, Astor. Hello, Molly. Nice to see you. J.J., Madeleine,\\nI\\'d like you to meet Jack Dawson. Well, Jack... ...are you of the Boston Dawsons? No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually. Oh, yes. He must have been nervous,\\nbut he never faltered. They assumed he was one of them. Heir to a rail road fortune, perhaps. New money, obviously,\\nbut still a member of the club. Mother, of course,\\ncould always be counted upon. Tell us of the accommodations in steerage\\nMr- Dawson- I hear they\\'re quite good- The best I\\'ve seen, ma\\'am. Hardly any rats. Mr. Dawson is joining us from third class. He was of help to my fiancée last night. It happens Mr. Dawson is quite a fine artist. He showed me some of his work today. Rose and I differ in our definition of fine art.\\nNot to impugn your work, sir. Are all these mine? Start from the outside and work in. He knows every rivet in her. Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Thank you, Rose. How do you take your caviar, sir? No caviar for me, thanks.\\nNever did like it much. Where exactly do you live, Mr. Dawson? Right now, my address is the RMS Titanic. After that, I\\'m on God\\'s good humor. How do you have means to travel? I work my way from place to place.\\nTramp steamers and such. I won my ticket on Titanic\\nat a lucky hand at poker. A very lucky hand. All life is a game of luck. A real man makes his own luck.\\nRight, Dawson? And you find\\nthat sort of rootless existence appealing? Yes, ma\\'am, I do. I\\'ve got everything I need\\nright here with me. I have air in my lungs\\nand blank sheets of paper. I love waking up, not knowing\\nwhat will happen or who I\\'ll meet. Where I\\'ll wind up. One night I\\'m sleeping under a bridge... ...now I\\'m on the grandest ship\\nin the world, with you fine people. I\\'ll take more of that. Life\\'s a gift. I don\\'t intend on wasting it. You never know what hand you\\'ll get dealt. You take life as it comes at you. Here, Cal. Make each day count. Well said, Jack. Hear, hear. To making it count. To making it count. Bravo. But Mr. Brown didn\\'t know\\nI\\'d hidden the money in the stove. He comes home drunk as a pig celebrating\\nand lights a fire. Next is brandy in the smoking room. Join me in a brandy, gentlemen? Now they retreat to congratulate each\\nother on being masters of the universe. Ladies, thank you for your company. May I escort you to the cabin? No, I\\'ll stay here. Here, Molly. Joining us, Dawson? You don\\'t want to stay with the women. No, thanks. I have to head back. That\\'s best. It\\'ll be all business and politics.\\nWouldn\\'t interest you. But Dawson, good of you to come. Must you go? Time for me to row with the other slaves. Good night, Rose. Want to go to a real party? Is okay I put my hand here? I can\\'t understand you. I\\'m going to dance with her now. Come on. Come on. Come with me. Jack. Jack, wait. I can\\'t do this. We\\'ll have to get a bit closer. Like this. You\\'re still my best girl, Cora. - I don\\'t know the steps.\\n- Me, either. Just go with it. Don\\'t think. Wait! Jack! Wait! Stop, Jack! Wh at? Wait! Jack, no. --Beyond the jurisdiction\\nof the Sherman Act. That\\'s what Rockefeller said--\\nSupreme Court didn\\'t swallow it. What? You think\\na first-class girl can\\'t drink? Get out of here. Are you all right? I\\'m fine. Two out of three. So... ...you think you\\'re tough? Let\\'s see you do this. Hold this for me, Jack. Hold it up. Jesus! You okay? I haven\\'t done that in years. Come on, lads. Give it all you got. Let\\'s go. Coffee, sir? You didn\\'t come to me last night. I was tired. Your exertions below deck\\nwere no doubt exhausting. I see you had\\nthat undertaker of a manservant follow me. You will never behave like that again. I\\'m not one of your mill foremen\\nwho you can command. I\\'m your fiancée. My fiancée. My fiancée! Yes, you are! And my wife! My wife in practice,\\nif not yet by law, so you will honor me! You will honor me the way\\na wife honors her husband. Because I will not be made a fool of. Is this in any way unclear? No. Good. Excuse me. Oh, Miss Rose. We had a little accident. - That\\'s all right.\\n- I\\'m sorry. Let me help you. It\\'s all right, miss. It\\'s all right, miss. Tea, Trudy. You\\'re not to see that boy again.\\nYou understand? Rose, I forbid it. Stop it, Mother.\\nYou\\'ll give yourself a nosebleed. This is not a game. Our situation is precarious.\\nYou know the money\\'s gone. Of course I know.\\nYou remind me every day. Your father left us nothing but a legacy\\nof bad debts hidden by a good name. That name is the only card we have to play. I don\\'t understand you. It is a fine match with Hockley.\\nIt will ensure our survival. How can you put this on me? Why are you being so selfish? I\\'m being selfish? Do you want to see me\\nworking as a seamstress? Is that what you want? To see our fine things sold at auction? Our memories scattered? It\\'s so unfair. Of course it\\'s unfair. We\\'re women. Our choices are never easy. Protect them by Thy guiding hand From every peril on the land O, spirit whom the Father sent To spread abroad the firmament O, wind of heaven, by Thy might Save all who dare the eagle \\'s ﬂight And keep them by Thy watchful care... Hello, Mr. Andrews. I need to talk to someone. You\\'re not supposed to be in here. I was here last night, remember? No. Now please turn around. He\\'ll tell you. I just need to talk-- Mr. Hockley and Mrs. DeWitt Bukater... ...are still appreciative of your assistance. They asked me\\nto give you this in gratitude-- I don\\'t want your money. --And remind you you are\\nin third class and your presence here... ...is no longer appropriate. Let me speak to Rose. Gentlemen, please see Mr. Dawson\\nreturns to where he belongs... ...and that he stays there? Yes, sir. Come along, you. Hear us when we cry to Thee For those in peril on the sea Why are there two steering wheels? We use this one near shore. Excuse me, sir.\\nAnother ice warning, from the Noordam. Thank you, Sparks. Not to worry.\\nQuite normal for this time of year. In fact, we\\'re speeding up.\\nI\\'ve ordered the last boilers lit. Okay, son, wind it up tight\\nlike I showed you. That\\'s right. Okay, now let it go. - It was good, wasn\\'t it?\\n- Quite nice. That\\'s excellent. Mr. Andrews...Forgive me. I did the sum\\nin my head... ...and with the number of lifeboats\\ntimes the capacity you mentioned... Forgive me, but it seems that there are\\nnot enough for everyone aboard. About half, actually. Rose, you miss nothing,\\ndo you? In fact, I put in these new\\ntype davits... ...which can take an extra row\\nof boats inside this one. But it was thought,\\nby some... ...the deck would look\\ntoo cluttered. So, I was overruled. It\\'s a waste of deck space\\nas it is on an unsinkable ship. Sleep soundly, young Rose. I have built you a good ship,\\nstrong and true. She\\'s all the lifeboat\\nyou need. Just keep heading aft. The next\\nstop will be the engine room. Jack, this is impossible.\\nI can\\'t see you. - I need to talk to you.\\n- No, Jack. No. Jack.\\nI\\'m engaged. I\\'m marrying Cal. I love Cal. Rose... ...you\\'re no picnic. All right?\\nYou\\'re a spoiled little brat even. But under that, you\\'re the\\nmost amazingly, astounding ...wonderful girl... ...woman, that I\\'ve ever known. Jack, I-- No, let me try and get\\nthis out. You\\'re ama-- I\\'m not an idiot.\\nI know how the world works. I\\'ve got ten bucks\\nin my pocket. I have nothing to offer\\nyou and I know that. I understand. But I\\'m too involved now. You jump, I jump\\nRemember? I can\\'t turn away without\\nknowing you\\'ll be all right. That\\'s all that I want. Well, I\\'m fine. I\\'ll be fine. Really. Really? I don\\'t think so. They\\'ve got you trapped, Rose. And you\\'re gonna die if you\\ndon\\'t break free. Maybe not right away... ...because you\\'re strong... ...but sooner or later that\\nfire that I love about you, Rose... ...that fire is gonna\\nburn out. It\\'s not up to you\\nto save me, Jack. You\\'re right. Only you can do that. I\\'m going back. Leave me alone. Tell Lucile about the disaster\\nyou had with the stationers. Well, of course the invitations\\nhad to be sent back, twice. Oh, my dear. And the dreadful\\nbridesmaids\\' gowns. Let me tell you what an\\nodyssey that has been. Rose decided she\\nwanted lavender. She knows I detest the color. So, she did it only to spite me. If only you\\'d come to\\nme sooner. Ruth saw some of my designs in\\nLa Mode Illustrée. They were for the trousseau of the Duchess\\nof Marlborough\\'s youngest daughter. They were quite charming. But, I think you\\'ll agree,\\nmy dear, that together... ...we\\'ve created something\\nof a phoenix from the ashes. Hello, Jack. I changed my mind. They said you might be up here. Give me your hand. Now close your eyes. Go on. Now, step up. Now, hold onto the railing. Keep your eyes closed.\\nDon\\'t peek. I\\'m not. Now, step up onto the rail. Hold on. Hold on. Keep your eyes closed. Do you trust me? I trust you. All right... ---Open your eyes. I\\'m flying. Jack. Come, Josephine, in my\\nﬂying machine. Going up... ...she goes. Up she goes. That was the last time\\nTitanic ever saw daylight. We\\'re up to dusk the\\nnight of the sinking. 6 hours to go. Incredible. There\\'s Smith and\\nhe\\'s standing there and... ...he\\'s got the iceberg warning\\nin his fucking hand... ...excuse me--his hand,\\nand he\\'s ordering more speed. 26 years of experience\\nworking against him. He figures anything big\\nenough to sink, the ship... ...they\\'re gonna see in time to turn. But the ship\\'s too big\\nwith too small a rudder. Doesn\\'t corner worth a damn. Everything he knows\\nis wrong. It\\'s quite proper, I assure you.\\nThis is the sitting room. - Will this light do?\\n- What? Don\\'t artists need good light? That is true, but I\\'m not\\nused to working in... ...such horrible conditions. Monet! - Do you know his work?\\n- Of course. Look at his use of color here.\\nIsn\\'t he great? I know. It\\'s extraordinary. Cal insists on carting\\nthis hideous thing everywhere. Should we be expecting him\\nany time soon? Not as long as the cigars\\nand brandy hold out. That\\'s nice. What is it,\\na sapphire? A diamond. A very rare diamond. Jack, I want you to draw me\\nlike one of your French girls. Wearing this. All right. Wearing only this. The last thing I need is another picture of me\\nlooking like a porcelain doll. As a paying customer... ...I expect to get\\nwhat I want. Over on the bed\\n...uh, the couch. Come. Lie down. - Tell me when it looks right.\\n- Keep that. Put your arm back\\nthe way it was. Put that other arm up,\\nthat hand right by your face there. Right. Now, head down. Eyes to me.\\nKeep them on me. And try to stay still. So serious. I believe you are blushing,\\nMr. Big Artiste. I can\\'t imagine\\nMonsieur Monet blushing. He does landscapes. - Just relax your face.\\n- Sorry. No laughing. My heart was pounding\\nthe whole time. It was the most erotic\\nmoment of my life... ...up until then, at least. So what happened next? You mean,\\ndid we do it? Sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Bodine. Jack was very professional. Thank you. What are you doing? Will you put this\\nback in the safe for me? Gentlemen, would you excuse me. None of the stewards\\nhave seen her. This is absurd.\\nIt\\'s a ship. There\\'s only so many\\nplaces she could be. Lovejoy, find her. - Clear.\\n- Yes. I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever\\nseen such a flat calm. Like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind. It will make the bergs\\nharder to see--- ...with no breaking\\nwater at the base. Well, I\\'m off. Maintain speed and\\nheading, Mr. Lightoller. Yes, sir. It\\'s getting cold.\\nYou look nice. Miss Rose? My drawings! Come on! Wait, wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait! - Go. Go. Down, down.\\n- Take us down, quickly. Quickly! Bye. Sorry. - Keep going.\\n- Thank you, I\\'ve got it. Pretty tough for\\na valet, this fella. Seems more like a cop. I think he was. - Oh, shit.\\n- Go! No, over here! Quick! Now what? Wh at? More coal for number\\none, mate. Hold up? What are you two\\ndoing down here? You shouldn\\'t be down here. It could be dangerous! Carry on! Don\\'t mind us. You\\'re\\ndoing a great job! Keep up the good work! Look at what we have here, huh? Thank you. Where to, miss? To the stars. You nervous? No. Put your hands on me, Jack. It\\'s bloody cold. You know, I can smell ice, you know.\\nWhen it\\'s near. Bollocks! Well, I can, all right? Did you ever find those\\nbinoculars for the lookouts? Haven\\'t seen them\\nsince Southampton. Well, I\\'ll be on\\nmy rounds. Cheerio. You\\'re trembling. Don\\'t worry. I\\'ll be all right. - They ran down there.\\n- Right. Anything missing? I have a better idea. GOI you! Did you see those guys\\' faces? Did you see them? When the ship docks... ...I\\'m getting off with you. This is crazy. I know. It doesn\\'t make any sense. That\\'s why I trust it. Here, look at this. Look at that, would you? They\\'re warmer than we are. If that\\'s what it takes for us to get warm,\\nI\\'d rather not. Bugger me! Pick up, you bastards! Is anyone there?! What do you see? Iceberg, right ahead! Thank you. Iceberg ahead! Hard a\\' starboard! Turn! Turn! Srnartly! Full astern! Hard over. Helm\\'s hard over, sir. Go, lads, go! Bring that steam down! Bring it down! Shut all the dampers! Shut them! Hold it. Hold it! Now! Engage reversing engine! Why ain\\'t they turning? Is it hard over?! It is, sir. Hard over. Come on, come on, come on. Turn. Yes. It\\'s going to hit! Jesus Christ! Jesus! Hard to port! Hard to port! Get back! Let\\'s go! They\\'re closing the doors! Get out! Get out the door! Go! Go! Come on, lads! Go, lads, go! Go! Go! Out! Out! Oh, my God. That was a close shave. Smell ice, can you? Bleedin\\' Christ! Note the time. Enter it in the log. What was that, Mr. Murdoch? An iceberg, sir. I put her hard to starboard, but it was too close. I tried to port round it, but-- - Close the watertight doors.\\n- They\\'re closed, sir. All stop. Have the carpenter sound the ship. Come on, let\\'s get the hell out of here! Why have the engines stopped? I felt a shudder. Not to worry. We threw a propeller blade. That\\'s the shudder you felt.\\nDo you need anything? No, thank you. There\\'s talk of an iceberg. I don\\'t see anything. Do you? If this is where the rats are going, I am, too. - You.\\n- There is no emergency. - There is. I\\'ve been robbed.\\n- Get the Master at Arms. Now, you moron! Did I miss the fun? - Did you see what happened?\\n- No- I guess it hit over there- Boiler room six is flooded eight feet\\nand the mail hold is worse. - Can you shore up?\\n- Not unless the pumps get ahead. - Have you seen the mail hold?\\n- It\\'s already underwater. This is bad. We should tell Mother and Cal. I think they\\'re very good, sir. Don\\'t touch anything.\\nI want the room photographed. We\\'ve been looking for you, miss. Here we go. Something serious has happened. Yes, it has. Indeed.\\nTwo things dear to me have disappeared. Now that one is back,\\nI know where to find the other. Search him. - Take your coat off.\\n- Now what? What are you doing?\\nWe\\'re in the middle of an emergency. - Is this it?\\n- That\\'s it. This is horseshit! Don\\'t you believe it. - He couldn\\'t have.\\n- Easy enough for a professional. I was with him the entire time. Perhaps he did it while you were putting\\nyour clothes back on, dear. Real slick. They put it in my pocket. - Shut up.\\n- It isn\\'t even your pocket. \"Property of A.L. Ryerson.\" That was reported stolen. I just borrowed it. Oh, we have an honest thief. You know I didn\\'t do this, Rose. Don\\'t believe them. You know it. Let\\'s go, son. You know I didn\\'t do it! There\\'s a good lad. Come on. You know I didn\\'t do it! You know me! This is most unfortunate, Captain. Water fourteen feet above the keel\\nin ten minutes... ...in the forepeak,\\nall three holds and boiler room six. That\\'s right. When can we get underway? That\\'s five compartments. She can float with four compartments breached,\\nbut not five. Not five. As she goes down,\\nthe water will spill... ...over the tops of the bulkheads at E deck,\\none to the next... ...back and back. There\\'s no stopping it. The pumps. The pumps buy you time, but minutes only. As of now, no matter what we do... ...Titanic will founder. But this ship can\\'t sink. She\\'s made of iron. I assure you, she can. And she will. It\\'s a mathematical certainty. How much time? An hour. Two, at most. How many aboard, Mr. Murdoch? Two thousand, two hundred souls, sir. Well, I believe you may get your headlines,\\nMr. lsmay. Oh, it is a little slut, isn\\'t it? Look at me when I\\'m talking to you! - Mr. Hockley?\\n- Not now. We\\'re busy. You\\'ve been asked to put on lifebelts\\nand go to the boat deck. I said, not now. I\\'m sorry, Mr. Hockley, but it\\'s Captain\\'s orders.\\nDress warmly. It\\'s quite cold out. May I suggest topcoats and hats? This is ridiculous. Not to worry, miss.\\nI\\'m sure it\\'s just a precaution. Everybody up! Lifebelts on! What\\'s he on about? - Put your lifebelts on!\\n- What is it? Just put them on. C.O.D.? Sir? That\\'s right, C.O.D. The distress call.\\nThat\\'s our position. Tell whoever responds we\\'re going down\\nand need immediate assistance. Blimey. Keep lowering! Keep lowering! Steady! Make it taut! And winch out! Uncover this boat! Uncover all the boats aft! Release those ties! Roll back that cover! Smartly now! Where are the passengers? They went inside- Too cold and noisy for them You there! Get down here\\nand help with these lines! Care for a drink, sir? Sonny, what\\'s doing? You get us all trussed up\\nand now we\\'re cooling our heels. Sorry, ma\\'am. Let me go find out. Nobody knows what\\'s going on. Just like the damn English--everything by the book. No need for language, Mr. Hockley. Go back and turn on the heaters in our rooms.\\nI want a cup of tea when I return. Mr. Andrews. I saw the iceberg. And I see it in your eyes. Please tell me the truth. The ship will sink. You\\'re certain? In an hour or so, all this\\nwill be at the bottom of the Atlantic. Please, tell only who you must.\\nI don\\'t want to cause a panic. And get to a boat. Quickly. Don\\'t wait. You remember what I told you about the boats? Yes. I understand. Over here, son. Sir, there\\'s a big mob\\nat the Second Class Purser\\'s office. Go on. I\\'ll watch him. Aye. Right. Sir, Carpathia says they\\'re making 17 knots.\\nFull steam for them, sir. She\\'s the only one responding? The only one close. They\\'ll be here in four hours. Four hours?! Thank you, Bride. My God. We are swung out and ready, sir. Hadn\\'t we better get the women and children\\ninto the boats? Yes. Women and children first, yes. Yes, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, attention, please! Step this way, please. That\\'s right. Come towards me. Thank you. Good. For the time being,\\nI require only women and children Right here. Like the Captain said,\\nnice and cheery, so there\\'s no panic. \"Wedding Dance.\" Lifebelts on. Put your lifebelts on. Put your lifebelts on. Lifebelt on. Here, put that lifebelt on. Turn it around. It isn\\'t time to go to the boats yet! Please, stay calm. Make sure you have your lifebelts on. Let women and children through to the front. What are we doing? Waiting. Once first-class people\\nare in the boats... ...they\\'ll start with us and we want to be ready. Pushing won\\'t get you out any faster. Go get help. Lower it away, left and right together! Steady. Both sides together! Steady! Steady! Steady! Stop, stop, stop! Hold the left! Right side only! Right side only! Right side! Hold the left! Right side down!\\nLower away together! Steady, lads! You know, I do believe this ship may sink. I\\'ve been asked to give you\\nthis small token of our appreciation. Compliments of Mr. Caledon Hockley. Come on, sister, you heard\\nthe man. Into the boat. Any room for a gentleman,\\ngentlemen? Only women at this time, sir. Will the lifeboats be\\nseated according to class? I hope they\\'re not too crowded. Oh, Mother, shut up! Don\\'t you understand? The water is freezing and\\nthere aren\\'t enough boats. Not enough by half. Half the people on this\\nship are going to die. Not the better half. Come on, Ruth,\\nget in the boat. First class seats\\nare right up here. You know, it\\'s a pity I didn\\'t\\nkeep that drawing. It\\'ll be worth a lot\\nmore by morning. You unimaginable bastard. Come on, Rose darling.\\nThere\\'s plenty of room for you. Come on, Rose. You\\'re next, darling. Come into the boat, Rose. Come. Rose. Get into the boat! Rose. Good-bye, Mother. Where are you going? To him?! To be a whore\\nto a gutter rat? I\\'d rather be his whore\\nthan your wife. No! I said, no! Rose!\\nPlease, stop! And, lower away! No, Wait! Lower away! - Rose!\\n- Lower together! Hold the left side! Help! Can anybody hear me?! Hello! Help me! Help me! Can you hear me?! Can anybody hear me?!\\nSomebody help me! Mr. Andrews?! Steward, check the\\nstarboard corridor. Madame, please put on a lifebelt.\\nGet to the boat deck immediately. Lucy, for God\\'s sake put on your\\nlifebelt and set a good example. Yes sir. - Anyone in here?\\n- Mr. Andrews! Mr. Andrews!\\nThank God! Where would the Master at Arms\\ntake someone under arrest? What? You have to get\\nto a boat right away. No! I\\'m doing this with or\\nwithout your help, sir. But without will take longer. Take the elevator to the\\nvery bottom. Go to the left... ...down the crewmen\\'s passage. Then go right and left\\nagain at the stairs. You\\'ll come\\nto a long corridor. This could be bad. Oh, shit!\\nOh, shit! Excuse me. Thank you. I\\'m sorry, miss,\\nbut the lifts are closed. I\\'m through being polite,\\ngoddamnit! Now take me down! E deck. Come on. Come on, come on. I\\'m going back up. No! No! No! Come back!\\nI\\'m going back up! I\\'m going back up! Crew passage. Jack! Rose! Rose, I\\'m in here! I\\'m in here! I\\'m in here! Jack! I\\'m sorry. I\\'m sorry. I\\'m so sorry. That guy Lovejoy put\\nit in my pocket. I know, I know, I know. Listen Rose... ...you\\'re gonna have to find\\nthe spare key, all right? Look in that\\ncabinet right there. It\\'s a little silver one, Rose. These are all\\nbrass ones! Check right here, Rose. Rose. How did you find out I didn\\'t do it? I didn\\'t. I just realized\\nI already knew. Keep looking. No key. There\\'s no key! All right, Rose, listen. You\\'re gonna have\\nto go find some help. It\\'ll be all right. I\\'ll be right back. I\\'ll just wait here! Hello?\\nls there anyone here? Hello? Is there anybody\\ndown here? We need help! Hello? Damnit! Can anybody hear me, please?!\\nHello?! Hello?! Oh, thank God. Wait, please, I need your help. There\\'s a man back\\nhere and he\\'s-- Wait! Hello?! Hello? Miss, you shouldn\\'t\\nbe here now. I need your help. There is a man down\\nhere and he is trapped. - This way, yes. All right.\\n- Please! - There\\'s no need to panic.\\n- No, I\\'m not panicking! You\\'re going the\\nwrong way! Let go of me!\\nListen!!! To hell with you. Oh, my God. Will this work? I guess we\\'ll\\nfind out. Come on. Wait, wait, wait. Try a couple practice\\nswings over there. Good. Now try and hit the same mark\\nagain, Rose. You can do it. Okay, that\\'s enough practice.\\nCome on, Rose. You can do it. Listen, just hit it really hard\\nand really fast. Come on. Wait. Open your\\nhands up a little more. - Like that?\\n- Right. Listen, Rose,\\nI trust you. Go. You did it! Come on. Let\\'s go. Oh shit, this is cold!\\nOh, shit! Shit! Shit! This is the way out. We have to find\\nanother way. Come on. Pull. Put your backs into it. Pull! Now, there\\'s something\\nyou don\\'t see every day. What\\'s this luggage doing here?\\nGet rid of it. Get rid of it. We need the room.\\nGet rid of that. Out. This way.\\nLet go, sir. Get back. Keep calm! Lovejoy! She\\'s not on the starboard side either. We\\'re running out of time. This strutting\\nmartinet isn\\'t letting any men on at all. There\\'s one on the other\\nside letting men on. Well then, that\\'s our play. We\\'ll need some\\ninsurance first. Come on. This way, please.\\nAll the way down here. Here! What do you\\nthink you\\'re doing? You\\'ll have to pay for\\nthat, you know. That\\'s White Star\\nLine property. Shut up! Will you hold the boat a moment?\\nI just have to run back to my room-- Sit down! She\\'s the last. - Prepare to lower.\\n- Mr. Lightoller. Why are the boats being\\nlaunched half full? Not now, Mr. Andrews. There, look. 20 or so\\nin a boat built for 65? And I saw one boat\\nwith only 12. 12! Well, we weren\\'t sure of\\nthe weight, Mr. Andrews. These boats may\\nbuckle. Rubbish! They were tested in Belfast\\nwith the weight of 70 men. Now, fill these boats, Mr. Lightoller.\\nFor God\\'s sake man! Please, I need more women\\nand children, please! Get back in there! This is not an exit.\\nThis is not an exit. You can\\'t keep us locked in here.\\nLike animals. The ship\\'s bloody sinking. Bring forward the women! Unlock the gates. Women only! No men! No men! Get back! Get back! Lock the gates! Get them back\\nfrom those gates! Don\\'t touch the gates! For God\\'s sake, man... ...there are women and\\nchildren down here! Let us up so we can have a chance! Get back! Tommy! - Can we get out?\\n- It\\'s hopeless that way. Whatever we do,\\nwe\\'ve got to do it fast. The boats are all going. This whole place is flooding.\\nWe\\'ve gotta get out of here. There is niente this way. Let\\'s go this way, all right?\\nCome on! I make my own luck. So do I. Come on! No, come on, let\\'s go this way. This way! Just go back to\\nthe main stairwell. And everything will be\\nsorted out there. It will all get sorted out back there. Go back to the main stairwell. - Open the gate!\\n- Go back down the main stairwell. Open the gate right now! Go back down the main\\nstairwell, like I told you. Goddamn it! Son of a bitch! Stop that! Fabri, Tommy,\\ngive me a hand here. Move aside. Come on, pull! Pull! Move aside.\\nQuickly, move aside! Put that down! - Move aside!\\n- Put that down! One! Two! Three! Again! Now, let\\'s go! Let\\'s go, Rose. You can\\'t go up there!\\nYou can\\'t do this! Keep order! Keep order here! Back! Back! Back! Hold on to her! Pull her in! Get back, I say, or I\\'ll... ...shoot you all like dogs! Keep order here! Keep order, I say. Mr. Lowe, man this boat. Right. ls everybody all right?\\nNobody panic. Stay back. We\\'re too late. There are more boats down the front.\\nStay with this one. Murdoch. He seems to be quite practical. Don\\'t lower it! Cut the falls! Sit down! Stay back, you lot! Just stay back, the\\nlot of you! Stay back! It\\'s starting to fall apart.\\nWe don\\'t have much time. Mr. Murdoch? Mr. Hockley.\\nYou two, with me, now! I\\'m a businessman, as you know... ...and I have a business\\nproposition for you. Come on, Rose. The boats are gone! Colonel, are there\\nany boats on that side? No, miss, but there are a couple\\nof boats all the way forward. This way, I\\'ll lead you. What\\'s the use?\\nNobody\\'s listening to us anyway. Well, they don\\'t listen to\\nus at dinner, either. Come on, let\\'s play. Keep us warm. \"Orpheus.\" Music to drown by.\\nNow I know I\\'m in first class. - Where is everyone?\\n- They\\'re all still aft, sir. We have an understanding\\nthen, Mr. Murdoch. Will the men please hold\\nback! Hold back, I say! Women and children only! Get back! Come through, madame.\\nThis way. Step back, sir! You better check the\\nother side. Go! I found her, on the other side. Waiting for a boat. With him. - Any more women and children?\\n- They\\'re all aboard, Mr. Murdoch. Anyone else then? - Anyone else?\\n- Do hurry. Hurry along. Goddamn it all to hell. Shit. Fire! Sir, sir, you can\\'t\\ngo through here. That\\'s it.\\nSplendid. Right. Prepare to lower. Ready on the left. Take them down. Keep it steady. Both sides together.\\nSteady. Keep it steady. - Give her to me.\\n- Daddy. It\\'ll be fine, darling.\\nDon\\'t you worry. Daddy, get in the boat. It\\'s good-bye for a little\\nwhile. Only for a little while. There\\'ll be another\\nboat for the daddies. This boat is for the\\nmummies and the children. You hold Mummy\\'s hand\\nand be a good little girl. I\\'m not going without you. No, you have\\nto go, now. Get in the\\nboat, Rose. No, Jack. Yes. Get on the boat! Yes, get on\\nthe boat, Rose. Oh my God, look at you. You look a fright. Here. Put this on. Come. Go on. I\\'ll get the next one. No, not without you. I\\'ll be all right.\\nListen, I\\'ll be fine. I\\'m a survivor, all right?\\nDon\\'t worry about me. Now, go on.\\nGet on. I have an arrangement with an\\nofficer on the other side of the ship. Jack and I can\\nget off safely. Both of us. See? I got my own\\nboat to catch. Go on, hurry. They\\'re almost full. - Step aboard, miss.\\n- Go. Go. Step aboard, please. You\\'re daddy\\'s\\ngood girl, all right? You\\'re my little sailor. Clear the rail, please. And, lower away!

I want to transfer all the women\\nfrom this boat into that boat right now... ...as quick as you can, please. Let\\'s create some space over there.\\nMove forward and aft. It\\'s getting quiet. It\\'s just going to take a\\ncouple of minutes... ...to get the boats organized. I don\\'t know about you but... ...I intend to write\\na strongly worded letter... ...to the White Star Line\\nabout all this. I love you, Jack. Don\\'t you do that. Don\\'t you say your\\ngood-byes. Not yet. Do you understand me? I\\'m so cold. Listen, Rose... ...you\\'re gonna\\nget out of here. You\\'re gonna go on... ...and you\\'re gonna\\nmake lots of babies. And you\\'re gonna\\nwatch them grow. You\\'re gonna die an old... ...an old lady. ...Warm in her bed. Not here. Not this night.\\nNot like this. Do you understand me? I can\\'t feel my body. Winning that ticket, Rose... ...was the best thing that\\never happened to me. It brought me to you. And I\\'m thankful\\nfor that, Rose- I\\'m thankful. You must... ...you must do me\\nthis honor. You must promise me\\nthat you\\'ll survive. That you won\\'t give up... ...no matter what happens. No matter how hopeless. Promise me now, Rose. And never let go\\nof that promise. I promise. Never let go. I\\'ll never let go, Jack. I\\'ll never let go. Right ahead, sir. Oars! Do you see any moving? No, sir. None\\nmoving, sir. Check them. Bring that oar up here. Check them.\\nMake sure. These are dead, sir. Now, give way. Ahead easy. Careful with your oars. Don\\'t hit them. Is there anyone\\nalive out there? Can anyone hear me? Is there anyone\\nalive out there? We waited too long. Well, keep checking them! Keep looking! Is there anyone\\nalive out there? Can anyone hear me? Come, Josephine... ...in my ﬂying machine And it\\'s up she goes Up she goes Come, Josephine... ___in my ﬂy\\'-\"9\"\" Jack. Jack. There\\'s a boat. Jack. There\\'s a\\nboat, Jack. Come back. Come back. Come back. Come back. Come back. Come back.\\nCome back! Hello! Can anyone hear me? There\\'s nothing\\nhere, sir. Come back. Come back. I\\'ll never let go. I promise. Come about! Fifteen hundred people\\nwent into the sea... ...when Titanic\\nsank from under us. There were twenty\\nboats floating nearby... ...and only one came back. One. Six were saved\\nfrom the water... ...myself included. Six... ...out of fifteen hundred. Afterward... ...the seven hundred\\npeople in the boats... ...had nothing to\\ndo but wait. Wait to die. Wait to live. Wait for an absolution... ...that would never come. Sir, I don\\'t think you\\'ll find any\\nof your people down here. It\\'s all steerage. His hair is reddish brown,\\nreddish brown, reddish brown. White beard. Isn\\'t there another\\npassenger list? There is no other list. Perhaps he\\'s on\\nanother ship. We\\'re doing all we can,\\nma\\'am. I\\'m so sorry. That\\'s the last time\\nI ever saw him. He married, of course,\\nand inherited his millions. But the Crash of \\'29 hit his interests hard... ...and he put a pistol in\\nhis mouth that year. Or so I read. Can I take your name\\nplease, love? Dawson. Rose Dawson. Thank you. We never found\\nanything on Jack. There\\'s no record\\nof him at all. No, there wouldn\\'t\\nbe, would there? And I\\'ve never spoken\\nof him until now. Not to anyone. Not even your\\ngrandfather. A woman\\'s heart is a\\ndeep ocean of secrets. But now you know there was\\na man named Jack Dawson... ...and that he saved me... ...in every way that\\na person can be saved. I don\\'t even have\\na picture of him. He exists now only\\nin my memory. Keldysh, Mir 2 on our\\nway to the surface. I was saving this for when\\nI found the diamond. I\\'m sorry. Three years... ...I\\'ve thought of\\nnothing except Titanic. But I never got it. I never let it in.'"
